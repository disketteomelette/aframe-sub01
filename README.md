# aframe-sub01
Sub01 is a library of 749 bytes including three useful components created for me to be used with A-frame js framework. These components can make an object bounce, reload the scene or simulate a first-person breathing animation on VR scene. 
# Usage
Simply add <script src="sub01.js"></script> between "head" tags and add to the needed a-frame object some of these components, and always AFTER the script call to a-frame. A well-stablished "cursor" object is needed for two of them.
# sub01-bounce
Animation on look. If the user looks to the object with this tag, the object will bounce itself. No arguments needed. 
# sub01-reload
Reload on look. If the user looks to the object with this tag, the scene will be reloaded.
# sub01-breath
Animation. Adding this to the camera will make a realistic simulation of first person breathing in VR.
